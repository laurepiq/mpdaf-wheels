# Building mpdaf wheels

This repository builds MacOS and Linux wheels on Travis for
[mpdaf](https://git-cral.univ-lyon1.fr/MUSE/mpdaf/), using
[cibuildwheel](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel).

Once built, the wheels are uploaded to the
[releases](https://github.com/musevlt/mpdaf-wheels/releases) page.
